# Demo Story Assets

This directory would contain images and other assets for the demo story.

In a real setup, you might have:
- cover.jpg (story cover image)
- chapter1-illustration.png
- map.svg (story world map)
- audio-clips/ (if supporting audio)

Reference these in your markdown like:
```markdown
![Story Cover](./cover.jpg)
![Chapter Illustration](./chapter1-illustration.png)
```

The server will automatically serve these files when the story pages are accessed.
