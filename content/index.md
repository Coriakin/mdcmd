# Welcome to MDCMS

This is the index page served at the root URL. The MDCMS system now supports serving an `index.md` file when visitors access the root path (`/`) of your site.

## Features

- **Markdown-based content** - Write your pages in simple markdown
- **Version control** - Support for multiple versions of pages
- **Admin dashboard** - Manage your content with ease
- **Analytics tracking** - Monitor visitor statistics
- **HTTPS support** - Secure by default

## Getting Started

Create your content by adding `.md` files to the `content/` directory. Use YAML front matter to configure page settings like title, theme, and visibility.

Enjoy your new CMS!
